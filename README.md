# Advanced Data types: they can store multiple values

## Lists 
- They are ordered, mutable (changeable, can add, replace or remove) collections of items
- They are defined by enclosing elements in square brackets.
- Example: fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry", 1]

## Tuples
- They are ordered, immutable (unchangeable, replace, add or remove) collections of items.
- They are defined by enclosing elements in parenthesis/ small brackets().
- Example: my_tuple = (1, 2, "apple")

## Sets
- They are unordered collection of unique elements (cannot have identical elements).
- They are useful for membership testing, removing duplicates from a sequence, and mathematical operations like union, intersection and difference.
- Cannot access elements using index operator []. You need to check if the elements exists in the set.
- They are defined by enclosing elements in curly brackets {}. 
- You can add elements to it
```
    Union operation: combining sets together, duplicate entries will be eradicated. 
    Intersection operation: common value when you combine sets
    Difference operation: returns a new set containing elements that are in the first set but not in the second set.
```    

## Dictionary
- Collection of key-value pairs, and they are mutable.
- Each key-value is unique, and the keys are used to store and retrieve values.
